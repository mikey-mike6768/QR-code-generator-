# QR Code Generator Project

## Overview

This project is a custom QR code generator built from scratch as a learning tool. The project covers important concepts such as:
- **Data Encoding**: Understanding QR code encoding methods (numeric, alphanumeric, byte, and Kanji).
- **Error Correction**: Implementing Reed-Solomon error correction for data resilience.
- **Grid Placement**: Correctly placing data and error correction bits in the QR code grid.
- **Rendering**: Visualizing the QR code and optionally adding customization, such as colors or logos.

This QR code generator is designed as an educational project, rather than a production-level system. It helps users understand how QR codes are constructed at a low level, from encoding the data to rendering the final image.

## Features

- **Data Encoding**: Supports alphanumeric encoding for generating QR codes.
- **Error Correction**: Uses Reed-Solomon error correction to make QR codes resistant to damage.
- **Custom Rendering**: Renders the QR code in a grid and supports customization like changing colors and adding logos.
- **Scalable**: Generates QR codes with different versions, starting from Version 1 (21x21 pixels).
  
## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The entire project is implemented in Python for data encoding, grid generation, and rendering.
- **Pillow**: Used for rendering and generating images of QR codes.
- **ReedSolomon**: Implements Reed-Solomon error correction.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mikey-mike6768/QR-code-generator-.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd QR-code-generator-
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   You may need to manually install dependencies like `Pillow` and `reedsolo`:

   ```bash
   pip install Pillow reedsolo
   ```

4. Run the project by executing `qr_render.py`:

   ```bash
   python qr_render.py
   ```

## How It Works

The project starts by taking the input string to be encoded. The following steps are carried out:

1. **Mode Detection**: Based on the input data, the QR code encoding mode (alphanumeric) is chosen.
2. **Data Encoding**: The input data is converted to a bit string using alphanumeric encoding.
3. **Error Correction**: Reed-Solomon error correction is applied to ensure the QR code is scannable even when parts are damaged.
4. **Grid Placement**: The data and error correction bits are placed in a QR code grid, following the QR code specification for timing patterns, finder patterns, and reserved areas.
5. **Rendering**: The final QR code is rendered as an image and displayed. Optionally, you can add logos and change the colors.

## Example Usage

```python
from qr_grid import initialize_qr_grid, place_data_in_grid
from qr_data_encoding import encode_alphanumeric
from qr_error_correction import apply_error_correction
from qr_render import render_qr

# Data to encode
data = "HELLO QR CODE"

# Encode the data
encoded_data = encode_alphanumeric(data)

# Apply error correction
encoded_data_with_correction = apply_error_correction(encoded_data)

# Initialize the QR grid
qr_grid = initialize_qr_grid()

# Place the data in the grid
qr_grid = place_data_in_grid(qr_grid, encoded_data_with_correction)

# Render the QR code
render_qr(qr_grid)
```

## Future Ideas and Improvements

Here are some future ideas to extend the functionality of the QR code generator:

### 1. **Support for Additional Encoding Modes**
   - Implement other encoding modes, such as **numeric** and **Kanji**.
   - Dynamically choose the best encoding mode based on the input.

### 2. **Enhanced Error Correction**
   - Allow users to select different levels of error correction (L, M, Q, H) when generating the QR code.

### 3. **Larger QR Code Versions**
   - Expand the generator to support more QR code versions (e.g., Version 2 up to Version 40).
   - Automatically adjust the version based on the amount of data being encoded.

### 4. **Dynamic QR Codes**
   - Add support for dynamic QR codes, where the content behind the QR code (such as URLs) can be updated without changing the code itself.

### 5. **Advanced Customization**
   - Allow users to fully customize the appearance of the QR code, including adding logos, adjusting the color scheme, and setting background patterns.
   - Add more graphical options, such as rounded edges and variable module shapes.

### 6. **Batch QR Code Generation**
   - Implement functionality for generating multiple QR codes in batch mode, such as for generating business card QR codes for a team.

### 7. **Web Interface or API**
   - Build a web interface or REST API for the QR code generator, allowing users to generate QR codes through a web browser.
